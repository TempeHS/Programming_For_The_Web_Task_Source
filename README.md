# Programming_For_The_Web_Task_Source
The project has been forked. There are now two flavours, each with more detailed step-by-step instructions for students, using the docs/README.md for easy copying of code snippets.
1. Python-based Flask PWA with SQLite3 database and BASH instructions.
  - [Source](https://github.com/TempeHS/Flask_PWA_Programming_For_The_Web_Task_Source) for teachers
  - [Student template](https://github.com/TempeHS/Flask_PWA_Programming_For_The_Web_Task_Template)
2. Node.js-based PWA with SQlite3 database and BASH instructions.
  - [Source](https://github.com/TempeHS/NodeJS_PWA_Programming_For_The_Web_Task_Source) for teachers
  - [Student template](https://github.com/TempeHS/NodeJS_PWA_Programming_For_The_Web_Task_Template)

Improvements:
  - Full documentation with step-by-step instructions in the docs/README.md
  - A frontend to backend extension task
  - The Node.js version has documented both Node.js and Python SQL data migration to frontend implementations.
  - A pre-completed **-source** version for teachers to test and demo the application and a **-template** version for students that auto-configures VSCode ready to start coding.
